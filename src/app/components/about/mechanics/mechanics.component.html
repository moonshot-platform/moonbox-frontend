                        Moonshot has a 10% fee on every transfer (both buy and sell). The fee break down is described below.

                    <p class="explanation">
                        Three percent of each transaction is automatically added to the liquidity pool. The liquidity pool is a pool of BNB and Moonshot tokens locked in the smart contract that is used to facilitate trade between the two assets on a DEX. It uses the automated market maker provided by PancakeSwap. When tokens are sold, the amount of Moonshot in the pool increases and the amount of BNB decreases, causing the price to drop. Vice versa, when tokens are bought, the amount of Moonshot in the pool decreases and the amount of BNB increass, causing the price to rise. Since MSHOT v2, the LP tokens are owned by the smart contract and a mechanism was added that allows the project to withdraw at most 10% of the liquidity once every 4 weeks.
