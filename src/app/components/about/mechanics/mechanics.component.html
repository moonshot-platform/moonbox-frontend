                        Moonshot is a deflationary, self-regenerating automatic liquidity providing protocol that pays out static rewards to holders. As our burn address is in the list of holders, the total supply of moonshot is forever decreasing.

                    <p class="explanation bold">Fee</p>
                    <p class="explanation">
                        Moonshot has a 10% fee on every transfer (both buy and sell). The fee break down is described below.

                    <p class="explanation bold">Reward distribution</p>
                    <p class="explanation">
                        Four percent of each transaction is distributed amongst Moonshot holders. This increases the incentive to hold the tokens in the wallets. As more transactions take place in the network, the net-worth of every individual increases as well.

                    <p class="explanation">
                        Three percent of each transaction is automatically added to the liquidity pool. This contributes to lower price volatility and a continuously increasing price floor.

                        The remaining three percent is used to support the project's development and marketing costs.
