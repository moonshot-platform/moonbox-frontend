            Our initial liquidity is locked by the team using the Dx Sale Network.
            You can view the lock <a
              href="https://dxsale.app/app/v3_3/dxlockview?id=0&add=0xF6d70C8e4FB171a3cF08FA5Ea4c458fbA85d3FE5&type=lplock&chain=BSC"
              target="_blank">here</a>. The LP tokens generated by the protocol
            are owned by the smart contract. Liquidity removal is limited (10%) and time locked to a maximum of once every 4 weeks. 
          </p>

          <p  class="explanation color-primary mb30">
            However, please keep in mind that the Liquidity Pool does not guarantee a specific price floor and that the LP tax we have
            intends to cushion large buys and large sells by adding part of the amount (3%) back into the LP.
          </p>

            Also, we have exempted wallet addresses from taxes (like, our project funding wallet, exchange's hot wallets and addresses for market makers).
            These addresses, do not pay a fee on transfer.
