        <p class="releasable-amount flex">MoonDust Miner is an idle game written in solidity. In the game, everyone has
          a moonbase where moonrovers collect moondust to mine for unobtainium. Players can choose to buy moonrovers,
          compound the moondust into unobtainium or it can be sold for a reward in BNB. The game is a shameless copy of
          the work pioneered by Ether Shrimp Farm
